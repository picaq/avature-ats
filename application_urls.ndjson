Market Data is information -- trades, quotes, and other pricing data -- gathered from around the world on every possible kind of financial instrument, from stocks and bonds to currencies and commodities, and other trading venues across the globe. In the aggregate, this amounts to several hundreds of billions of events across 100 million instruments.  Read our blog to know more!\n\nOur Teams\nTicker Plant is organized into the following functional areas.\n\nMarket Data Distribution handles the movement of real-time market data in and out of the Ticker Plant system.  This group owns and develops infrastructure that carries hundreds of billions of events originating from across thousands of machines spanning hundreds of clusters with low latency.  In addition to the distribution infrastructure, this group provides sharding infrastructure that enables horizontal scalability of the Ticker Plant.\n\nDatabase Infrastructure develops a high performance time-series database that supports low latency data storage and retrieval for high-volume applications, and stores all Market Data at Bloomberg. The storage engine hosts several petabytes of data, across hundreds of millions of instruments.  The query engine handles ~100 billion queries daily ranging from interactive queries to batch queries at very high throughputs of up to 100K QPS.\n\nData Content area focuses on APIs, systems and services which transform, enrich, store and publish these market data events, relying on externally provided middleware and persistence technology solutions.\n\nWe are looking for motivated engineers in Database Infrastructure and Market Data Distribution areas to help build the next generation Ticker Plant!\n\nOur Technology\nBeing the core of the market data infrastructure, the Ticker Plant system by necessity is scalable, distributed, highly performant, and stable.  To be highly performant, most of the critical software is written in C++. Python is also extensively used to build auxiliary services around the critically important software and to enable automation.  In addition, we use a wide range of engineering strategies to solve problems ranging from using off the shelf software (like kafka) to implementing our own algorithms/solutions (e.g custom built database), as appropriate for the problem at hand.\n\nWhat we do\nWe have some unique challenges where we not only have to optimize for scale (billions of data points, hundreds of hosts) but also for very high throughput of updates and queries, all at the same time.  As market data volume increases each year, these challenges get harder to meet with the current infrastructure and so we are re-architecting and re-writing the core parts of our system to make the system simpler and easier to scale.  Some examples are:\n\nConsolidate existing data distribution mechanisms onto a fast, loss-less, resilient market data distribution infrastructure.\nImprove scalability of the Ticker Plant by separating data processing and data storage layers, making them independently scalable and ultimately moving storage and query layers to cloud infrastructure.\nModernize data storage technologies by adopting industry best practices\n\nWhat is in it for you:\nHands-on experience working on large scale distributed systems\nJoin a group in the early stages of a major system re-architecture\nWork on core computer science problems such as efficient data storage, data discoverability, data transmission and distribution\nWork with high-caliber individuals and experienced teams of engineers and management\nBe challenged with trying to make our system more modular and horizontally scalable\n\nWe’ll trust you to:\nTake full ownership of technical solutions/features\nDesign, implement, and own critical applications/components of our infrastructure stack\nWrite quality code with automated tests\nCollaborate with other engineers in the team and with our CTO office & business partners\n\nYou’ll need to have:\nExperience programming in C++/Python or other object oriented languages\nBS, MS, PhD in Computer Science, Engineering or related technology field or relevant boot camp experience\nDeep desire to learn and understand software infrastructure\n\nOur culture:\nWe’re proud of our culture and collaboration sits at the centre of how we operate, you’ll collaborate across teams and locations on a global scale, both virtually and in person.\nEngineers at Bloomberg actively shape the direction of our technology and products, helping drive innovation.\nFrankfurt is one of 12 engineering hubs at Bloomberg, since being established in 2014 Frankfurt has enjoyed consistent growth, now with 140 employees and 90 in engineering, the office has become an integral part of Bloomberg's global tech communities and initiatives.\nWe employ a hybrid work model, which gives our engineers flexibility but also allows us to collaborate across teams.\nWe’re big advocates of getting together and sharing ideas, we hold regular internal and external tech, social and philanthropic events to strengthen our relationships with the local community.\nOur Frankfurt office is in the heart of the city, it's also newly refurbished, so for the days that you’re in the office you can enjoy brand-new facilities, which include a fully stocked pantry serving breakfasts and lunches.\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/company/stories/meet-the-teams-frankfurt-engineering/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18011879281399528/\n\nAlongside a great culture, we also offer Frankfurt employees a comprehensive list of benefits, which include:\n\n100% coverage on health insurance costs for employees and eligible family members\n30+ days holiday per year\nEndless opportunities to participate in philanthropic events and charity days\nSponsorship for continuous education and professional development","DatePosted":"","Location":""}

Mike Bloomberg speaks about SFS in the Bloomberg Impact report here.\nYou can learn more about our climate analytics offering here.\nSFS Climate Analytics\nThe Climate team was formed at the start of 2023. Climate change is a global problem for which Bloomberg wants to develop leading solutions. Our goal is to publish data & show analytics that inform how firms make environment-related investments. With each of our projects, we ask “what are the climate insights for our customers?”. In the past year, we built emissions pathways for 150K companies accurate to their industry and region. We added new carbon target indicators that allow analysts to download bulk data on 25K company carbon targets. To put it all together, we are working with Index on climate alignment scores to show how a company is performing today and in the future compared to their pathway and trend emissions forecast. All of our datasets need to be transparent, accurate to the methodology, and provide as wide coverage as possible.\nFor Climate Alignment Scores, customers want to know if their portfolio is on track to decarbonize. It helps them evaluate which companies are aligned with a benchmark pathway in terms of their GHG emissions intensity. We need to fetch targets (company pledges to reduce emissions X% by Y year) from different internal and external sources and calculate datasets to answer different pledge types, benchmark comparisons, and year to year emissions. We will also have a terminal experience to allow analysts to explore the carbon targets.\nWhat's in it for you?\n\nYou’ll need to have:\nWe'd love to see:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","DatePosted":"","Location":""}
